## Introduction

This project is a deep learning-based image classification task that aims to distinguish between cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project employs Python, Keras, and various libraries to train and evaluate the model on a dataset of cat and dog images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of cat and dog images. It is divided into two subsets: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the CNN, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance. The data is preprocessed to ensure uniformity and compatibility with the CNN architecture.

## Convolutional Neural Network

A CNN is a deep learning architecture well-suited for image processing tasks. In this project, a CNN is designed with the following layers:

- **Convolutional Layers:** These layers use filters to scan and extract features from the input images.
- **Max Pooling Layers:** These layers downsample the output of convolutional layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
- **Dropout Layers:** These layers help prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating a fraction of neurons during training.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** These layers combine extracted features to make final predictions.

The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer and loss function to ensure effective training.

## Training and Evaluation

The CNN model is trained on the training dataset for a specified number of epochs. After training, its performance is evaluated on the test dataset. The training and validation loss and accuracy are monitored to assess the model's performance. The project visualizes the training progress using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## Results

The project's CNN model successfully classifies cat and dog images, achieving competitive accuracy on the test set. The training and validation loss and accuracy plots provide insights into the model's training process.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the development and training of a Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of cats and dogs. It showcases the importance of data preprocessing, model architecture design, and training. The results indicate that the CNN performs well in distinguishing between cat and dog images, offering promising prospects for image classification tasks.
